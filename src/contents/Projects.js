                <p>Most of my experience comes from assignments done in the University courses and my game development internship at Zaibatsu Interactive.</p>

                <p></p>
                <p>A game prototype made in Phaser 3 with registration and scorekeeping made in PHP. Made in a three person group as a final assignment for a course.</p>

        <h2>Grappler Unity 3D game prototype</h2>
        <p>This game prototype was made in a game programming course which mostly focused on coding and getting the core loop of the game together.</p>

       <h2>My home page</h2>
                <p>Of course I have also made these pages myself, starting in a course and continuing development afterwards. I have a new website under development using React JS to create a more easily expandable and manageable site.</p>
                
        <h2>Other projects</h2>
                <p>I have also participated in several course projects for example making a working prototype of an application for choosing what clothes to wear for a customer provided by the school.</p>
